# 🎨 ColorPicker
The .NET MAUI implementation is intentionally very minimalistic, as the technology is not yet fully optimized for handling frequent value changes in controls such as *Entry* and *Slider* (unlike *WPF*). The control provides a graphical interface for adjusting both the color and its transparency.

## 🔧 Installation
The core library `ColorPicker.Core` and the *.NET MAUI* UI implementation `ColorPicker.View.Maui` (including `ColorPicker.Core`) are available as NuGet packages:

```powershell
dotnet add package ColorPicker.Core
```
```powershell
dotnet add package ColorPicker.View.Maui
```

## 🧬 .NET MAUI Control template parts (PART_*)
When using the *ColorPicker*, you must always define the layout of its individual parts in *ControlTemplate*.

The final color selection is handled through *PART_ColorSelectionView*, where you can also configure the selection circle radius using the *MarkRadius* property on this element.

Transparency adjustment is performed through *PART_AlphaSelectionView*. This component automatically adapts to its available size. If its height is greater than its width, the entire layout switches to a vertical orientation.

The view that displays the resulting color is *PART_SelectedColorView*.

To display the resulting color in hexadecimal form, you can use *PART_HexLabel*.

None of these component parts are mandatory.
The resulting color of the *ColorPicker* can be bound to your *ViewModel* through the *SelectedColor* property, which allows you to use only *PART_ColorSelectionView* and build the rest of the UI yourself.

## 🧩 Implementations
A simple, minimalist implementation. This setup is entirely mouse- and touch-driven and includes only the all template parts required to select a color.

```xml
xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:ColorPicker.View.Maui;assembly=ColorPicker.View.Maui"
```
```xml
<controls:ColorPicker SelectedColor="{Binding SelectedColor, Mode=TwoWay}" Margin="4">
    <controls:ColorPicker.ControlTemplate>
        <ControlTemplate>
            <Grid>
                <Grid.RowDefinitions>
                    <RowDefinition Height="*"/>
                    <RowDefinition Height="50"/>
                    <RowDefinition Height="50"/>
                    <RowDefinition Height="26"/>
                </Grid.RowDefinitions>

                <!--Color selection-->
                <components:ColorSelectionView x:Name="PART_ColorSelectionView" />

                <!--Alpha selection-->
                <components:AlphaSelectionView x:Name="PART_AlphaSelectionView" Grid.Row="1" Margin="0,3" />

                <!--Selected color-->
                <components:SelectedColorView x:Name="PART_SelectedColorView" Grid.Row="2" Margin="0,3"/>

                <!--HEX-->
                <Grid Grid.Row="3" Margin="0,3">
                    <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
                        <ColumnDefinition Width="Auto" />
                        <ColumnDefinition Width="*" />
                    </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>

                    <Label Text="HEX" Margin="0,0,5,0" />
                    <Label x:Name="PART_HexLabel" Grid.Column="1" />

                </Grid>

            </Grid>
        </ControlTemplate>
    </controls:ColorPicker.ControlTemplate>
</controls:ColorPicker>
```
For the Android platform, it is recommended to adjust the color selection radius for optimal usability.
```xml
<components:ColorSelectionView x:Name="PART_ColorSelectionView" MarkRadius="30" />
```

## 🔎 Project sample
The solution includes one sample (`ColorPicker.Maui.App1`) applications demonstrating how to use the ColorPicker libraries. The application is cross-platform and can be run on multiple platforms.
These sample show:

* Integration of `ColorPicker.View.Maui`

* How to bind the *SelectedColor* of ColorPicker to your own *ViewModel*

* Practical usage of color UI components

You can explore the sample projects to see ready-to-use implementations and learn how to integrate the libraries into your own *.NET MAUI* applications.
